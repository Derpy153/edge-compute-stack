# edge-compute-stack  

## Overview  
edge-compute-stack is a modular framework for optimizing resource allocation and processing at the edge. this project aims to provide a scalable solution for distributed systems leveraging edge computing paradigms.  

## Features  
- **asynchronous task execution**: improve throughput in high-load scenarios.  
- **resource-aware scheduling**: dynamically allocate resources based on workload profiles.  
- **latency minimization**: prioritize low-latency operations for critical tasks.  
- **modular design**: easily integrate with existing microservice architectures.  

## Use Cases  
- real-time analytics  
- iot device coordination  
- high-frequency trading (hft) systems  
- content delivery network (cdn) optimization  

## Roadmap  
- [ ] integrate predictive analytics for workload distribution  
- [ ] extend support for containerized environments  
- [ ] add benchmarking tools for performance evaluation  
- [ ] implement support for edge-ai workloads
